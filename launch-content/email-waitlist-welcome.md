## Email Body

Hey,

You just joined the SnapFix Pro waitlist. Here's what that means:

**What you signed up for:**
Early access to SnapFix Pro when it launches in ~3 weeks.

Pro tier includes:
- Unlimited debug loops (free tier is 5/day)
- Claude/GPT integration with your own API keys
- Auto-apply fixes (no confirmation prompts)
- Shareable debug reports with custom domains
- Priority access to new features

**What you can do right now:**
The free CLI is already live. Try it:

```bash
npm install -g snapfix
snapfix npm install  # or any command that breaks
```

Free tier uses local LLMs (Ollama) - zero cost, works offline.

**When to expect Pro launch:**
~3 weeks. I'll email you when it's ready. No spam in between.

**Why I built this:**
I got tired of taking 40+ screenshots per failed `npm install` and manually pasting them into ChatGPT. So I automated the entire loop. If you've ever rage-quit an install at 2am, you'll get it.
