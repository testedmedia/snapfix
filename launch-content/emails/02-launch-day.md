# Email 2: Launch Day Announcement

**Subject:** SnapFix is live. Stop screenshotting errors.

**Body:**

It's here.

SnapFix automates the most annoying part of development: the debug loop.

You know the one. Run a command. It fails. Screenshot. Paste into ChatGPT. Read the fix. Apply it. Run again. New error. Screenshot again. Repeat 20-40 times.

Now it's one command:

```
snapfix npm install
```

SnapFix runs your command, detects errors, sends full system context to AI, gets a fix, shows it to you, applies it on approval, and loops until success.

**Works with everything:**
npm, pip, brew, docker, cargo, go, make, cmake -- anything that runs in a terminal.

**Your choice of AI:**
Claude, GPT-4o, or Ollama (100% free, runs locally).

Install it:
```
npm install -g snapfix
```
