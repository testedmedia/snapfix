# Email 3: DevRel Outreach (Cold email to developer advocates)

**Subject:** SnapFix auto-debugs installs of [THEIR_PRODUCT] -- want to co-promote?

**Body:**

Hey [NAME],

I built SnapFix -- a CLI tool that auto-fixes installation errors using AI.

When developers run `snapfix npm install [your-package]` and hit errors, SnapFix automatically diagnoses the issue, suggests a fix, and applies it. No more pasting screenshots into ChatGPT.

Why this matters for [COMPANY]: every installation failure is a potential churn event. SnapFix turns failed installs into successful ones automatically.

Would love to:
1. Add [PRODUCT]-specific error patterns to our database
2. Cross-promote to our developer audience
3. Feature [PRODUCT] in a "SnapFix + [PRODUCT]" tutorial

We're open source (MIT), 100% free tier, and growing fast ([X] GitHub stars in [Y] days).

Happy to jump on a 15-min call or just trade tweets.

Best,
