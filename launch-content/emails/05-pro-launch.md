# Email 5: Pro Tier Launch

**Subject:** SnapFix Pro is live. First 100 users: 50% off forever.

**Body:**

Pro is here.

You signed up early, so you get the deal nobody else gets: **50% off forever.** That's $7.50/month instead of $15. Locked in as long as you're subscribed.

**What Pro unlocks:**
- Unlimited debug loops (free tier: 5/day)
- Claude + GPT-4o integration
- Shareable debug reports (public links)
- No "Powered by SnapFix" watermark
- Priority error pattern database (fixes are faster + more accurate)

**This deal expires when 100 spots fill.** [X] spots remaining.

Upgrade now: https://snapfix.dev/pro

Already using the free tier? Your config carries over. Just run:
```
snapfix config set pro.key YOUR_PRO_KEY
```

Not sure yet? The free tier isn't going anywhere. Keep using it. Pro is for when you're tired of the 5/day limit.
