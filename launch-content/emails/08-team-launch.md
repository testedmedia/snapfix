# Email 8: Team Tier Launch

**Subject:** New: SnapFix for Teams. Know how long onboarding actually takes.

**Body:**

Quick question: how long does it take a new developer to go from `git clone` to first successful build on your project?

If you don't know the answer, that's the problem.

**SnapFix Team ($39/seat/month) gives you:**

**Setup Playbooks** -- Record a successful install as a replayable script. New dev joins, runs the playbook, SnapFix auto-fixes anything that breaks on their machine.

**Onboarding Analytics** -- See exactly how long setup takes, which deps fail most, and where developers get stuck.

**Team Dashboard** -- All debug sessions in one view. Which projects are painful. Which errors are common. Where to invest in better docs.

**CI/CD Integration** -- GitHub Action auto-generates debug reports on failed builds. Posted right to the PR.

**Slack Notifications** -- Failed builds alert the right channel with diagnosis already attached.
